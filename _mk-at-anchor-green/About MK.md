MOE Kindergarten @ Anchor Green began its operations in January 2019. Sited at Anchor Green Primary School, it offers Kindergarten 1 and Kindergarten 2 programmes to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. The MK@Anchor Green also has a Kindergarten Care (KCare) service that currently offers before school care to our enrolled MK children.
