<td>Most children have interactions with their family doctors only when they fall sick. This time, the K2 children had their first-hand experience to interview a doctor, Dr Colin Low (Pancare Medical Clinc Hougang) face-to-face to find out how the different organs in their bodies function. They were excited, with some posing more than one question for the doctor. </td>

They learnt that besides the traditions of spring cleaning, putting decorations and home visiting, there is also 守岁 (Shou Sui), where children stay up as late as possible for their parents' longevity. They also had their first-hand experience of 菜青 (Cai Qing), a special performance put up by the teachers, which sent them into screams and shrieks of excitement!
