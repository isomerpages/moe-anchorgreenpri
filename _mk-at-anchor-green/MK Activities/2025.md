			<td valign="middle"><br><br>At MK@AG, our young learners recently took part in a meaningful celebration of both World Water Day and Earth Day, engaging in a variety of hands-on activities designed to deepen their understanding of environmental responsibility.<br><br>
To start, children were encouraged to bring their own water bottles from home. Throughout the day, they used the water they brought to wash their hands—such as after outdoor play or before snack time—highlighting the importance of conserving water in daily routines. This simple but effective activity helped students become more aware of how much water they use and how small changes can make a big difference.
