To start, children were encouraged to bring their own water bottles from home. Throughout the day, they used the water they brought to wash their hands—such as after outdoor play or before snack time—highlighting the importance of conserving water in daily routines. This simple but effective activity helped students become more aware of how much water they use and how small changes can make a big difference.
