<p>Our Malay Senior Teacher Mr Mohamad Firuz Jelaludin, who has been teaching
for 17 years, has crowned the AGAB under the Exemplary Category in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He utilizes technology to attract the interest of his students. He agreed
that teachers need to be creative in choosing learning resources that suit
the different needs of students. For example, students are given tasks
such as producing comic strips, cartoon characters and video animations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He thinks that students will be more enthusiastic if Malay subjects are
taught in an interesting and fun way. One of the initiatives he started
is the Proverb Cube teaching material to help P3 students to understand
proverbs or idioms more easily.&nbsp;</p>
