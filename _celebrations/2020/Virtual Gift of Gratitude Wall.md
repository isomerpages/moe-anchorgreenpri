# Virtual Gift of Gratitude Wall
In line with our school’s vision of building a community of aspiring and gracious learners, the school has provided opportunities for our students to demonstrate graciousness in them, and uplift their spirit and those around them and also to help them maintain a positive mindset especially during these exceptional times of COVID 19.

The students were given the opportunity to express their gratitude and thanks to those people whom they have worked or interacted with, someone who have made an impact in their lives. Our students have come forth through writing down their gratitude to that someone special in them. Some of our students’ work are shown in our school’s Virtual Gift of Gratitude Wall below.

We hope you can enjoy their hard work and dedication through this virtual wall.
