<p><strong>Anchorlites celebrated AGPS’ 15th Anniversary (AG15)!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Anchor Green Family came together to celebrate her 15th anniversary
on <strong>7th July 2023</strong>. It was a time to appreciate how far we
have come and to embrace the present well as the exciting future that lies
ahead.The school was established in December 2007 to serve the growing
number of young families in the new town of Sengkang.</p>
<p>The school opened with an enrolment of 273 students in nine classes from
Primary One to Primary Three. Now, we have grown to a full enrolment of
1416. Our students have been developed and we will continue to develop
them holistically, expand their potential and contribute back to the community.</p>
<p>The commemoration started off with the Sunrise programme where Anchorlites
got to watch a video clip on the 15-year journey the school has taken thus
far. A range of activities was planned for our Anchorlites to have a joyful
celebration and we ended the day with “This is Me”, a whole-school performance.</p>
<p>The celebration continued in the evening with the Sunset programme. Honourable
guests, our alumni, former teachers and Parent Support Group members were
invited to grace the occasion and it was indeed Homecoming for them! The
evening came alive with students’ performances, Netball exhibition games,
viewing of innovative project booths and much more. It was a memorable
celebration for all and it has allowed our Anchor Green family to realise
that we have come a long way. We are also thankful that we have made such
great progress and now is the time to take that leap of faith, to embrace
the unknown, and embark on the next phase of our journey.</p>
