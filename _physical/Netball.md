“If you’re really passionate about the game, you’ll always put your best foot forward. Whatever position you’re put in, that is the passion you have to get the turnovers, to get the shots in, and pass the ball to your teammates. That’s the passion you need to have for the game, and the drive you need to succeed. If you’ve got the passion then you’ll always be there training and you’ll be a real team player,” Kadeen Corbin, England and Team Bath. 

  

As netball is a team sport, our students learn valuable social and communication skills as they work with others as part of a team to achieve a common goal. Each player is assigned a position, which is constrained to different parts of the court and plays a different role within the game, this means that no game can be played or be won without the help of all members of the team. Team members must communicate with one another and work together to defend the attack and score goals.

  

Netball is also a fast-moving game that requires players to run around the court, sprinting and changing direction quickly, over time this greatly improves the student’s cardiovascular fitness and strength. Training also involves a variety of fitness and skills drills, which help to develop fitness so that all team members are primed, and ready come games day.  

  

During a 3-month period from March to May 2019, the Junior Division Team and Senior Division Team represented Anchor Green Primary School at the SPSSC North Zone Netball Championships 2019. 

  

We are proud of our two teams - Both the Junior and Senior Division Teams came in 3rd. The school believes that all athletes can achieve success because this relates to the effort put into realizing one’s personal potential.
