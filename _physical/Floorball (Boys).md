AGPS Floorball CCA is a fun and fast-paced sport which requires great teamwork and discipline among the team members. This sport is easy to pick up and one can easily learn in a matter of minutes. However, it requires resilience and determination to excel in this sport. As the students excel in this sport, they will also be given the opportunity to represent the school and participate in the National Schools Floorball Tournament. 

In Anchor Green Primary School, apart from playing and learning the skills of the game, we also focus on grooming leadership among the students, allowing them to take turns to conduct warm-ups and lead their juniors under the guidance of the coach and teachers-in-charge. Students learn how to communicate effectively, work cooperatively and make responsible decisions. 

Our floorball alumni also come back during the holidays to impart their knowledge and skills to the next generation of floorball players, as well as role modeling and being an inspiration to the younger players.<br>
