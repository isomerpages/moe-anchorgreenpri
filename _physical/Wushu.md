AGPS Wushu is a place dedicated to students who love Chinese martial arts. It is a performance sport where students are trained in different kinds of Wushu routines, skills, and movements. The training aims to develop self-discipline, respect, confidence, and resilience among the students. Students who are familiar with the routines, skills, and movements in the process of learning, are offered opportunities for growth and achievement through participating in the National School Game Wushu Competition. During the competition and school performances, our Wushu members have shown confidence, excellence, and team spirit in executing the learnt routines. AGPS Wushu not only hopes to continue to spread the martial spirit of Wushu but also to nurture the students and build on this success for greater achievements.
