Basketball (Boy) was formed since the AGPS started and was one of the popular sports among student. 

The CCA provides opportunities for students to enact the schoolâ€™s value of agility and resilience through the various pathways. Through regular participation in the weekly CCA sessions, students grow not only in their basketball technical skills but learnt to be an agile learners and gracious citizen who are a respectful collaborators.

At the end of the Senior Division NSG season, P6 students also serve by helping the juniors to improve their skills and prepare them for the Junior Division games.

For those aspiring to join the school team, students will be exposed to additional training and friendly matches with other schools to increase their experience and be a confident player.
