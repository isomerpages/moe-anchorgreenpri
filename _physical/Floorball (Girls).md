<p>Floorball (Girls) was formed in 2016 and has been steadily rising to be
one of the top teams in the National Schools Games with consistent performance.</p>
<p>The CCA provides opportunities for students to enact the school’s motto
of Aspire, Grow and Serve through the various pathways. Through regular
participation in the weekly CCA sessions, students <strong>grow</strong> not
only in their floorball technical skills but in the CCE21 competencies
such as self-awareness, relationship management, responsible decision making
and collaborative skills.</p>
<p>Students also <strong>serve</strong> through partnership with APSN (Association
for Persons with Special Needs) Chaoyang School where they will train alongside
students with mild intellectual disability (MID) and help them to improve
their skills. Our students also get to visit the school and learn about
the facilities and how different the school setting is as compared to mainstream
primary schools. Students in the recreation team will be given the option
to participate in Play Inclusive, where teams with students from partnering
special and mainstream schools will compete against one another.</p>
<p>At the end of the Senior Division NSG season, P6 students also serve by
helping the juniors to improve their skills and prepare them for the Junior
Division games.</p>
<p>For those <strong>aspiring</strong> to join the school team, students will
be exposed to additional training and friendly matches with other schools
to increase their experience and be a confident player.</p>
