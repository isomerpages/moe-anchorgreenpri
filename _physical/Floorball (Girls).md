Floorball (Girls) was formed in 2016 and has been steadily rising to be one of the top teams in the National Schools Games with consistent performance.

The CCA provides opportunities for students to enact the schoolâ€™s motto of Aspire, Grow and Serve through the various pathways. Through regular participation in the weekly CCA sessions, students **grow** not only in their floorball technical skills but in the CCE21 competencies such as self-awareness, relationship management, responsible decision making and collaborative skills.

Students also **serve** through partnership with APSN (Association for Persons with Special Needs) Chaoyang School where they will train alongside students with mild intellectual disability (MID) and help them to improve their skills. Our students also get to visit the school and learn about the facilities and how different the school setting is as compared to mainstream primary schools. Students in the recreation team will be given the option to participate in Play Inclusive, where teams with students from partnering special and mainstream schools will compete against one another.

At the end of the Senior Division NSG season, P6 students also serve by helping the juniors to improve their skills and prepare them for the Junior Division games.

For those **aspiring** to join the school team, students will be exposed to additional training and friendly matches with other schools to increase their experience and be a confident player.
