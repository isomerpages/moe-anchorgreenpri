We aim to train our young ones (Cub Scout) by equipping them with the same set of values and skills, both the School and CCA, to be a confident, self-directed person who is an active contributor and a concerned citizen of Singapore – MOE’s Desired outcomes of Education.

We engage them with meaningful activities (both indoors and outdoors) in stages to aid them in their development from the moment they take on the CCA to the end of their primary school life.

Scouting skills like leadership skill, foot drill, life skills, track and trail, navigation, knotting, knowing the weather, planetary system, nature, and science, arts and crafts, knowing oneself and one’s country, and many more will teach them to be confident and independent individuals. 

Scouting is a wholesome CCA that encompasses various skills. The skills learnt, will allow pupils to earn badges from the wide-ranging proficiency skills like gardening, craftsman, navigator etc. Apart from scouting skills, they can also participate in National Campaign courses like World Water Day, and Climate Action Ambassador, which will teach them to be active contributors to the community as well as be concerned citizens.
