Parents Gateway
===============

  

Parents are strongly encouraged to download the one-stop mobile app (Parents Gateway), specially curated by MOE for parents. It allows schools to update parents on programmes and activities, as well as provides a platform for administrative matters such as giving consent for children’s participation in school activities.

  

Do view the two-minute video clip below to understand the rationale of Parents Gateway and how to sign up.

  

We will progressively roll out the use of the app, and the school’s Bulletin is also made available through Parents Gateway. We hope that all parents will download the app and make full use of the features available.
