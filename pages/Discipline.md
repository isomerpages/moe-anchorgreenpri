#### Framework:
![Discipline Framework](/images/Discipline/Discipline_Framework.jpg)
At the core of the framework, the balance symbolises equilibrium and fairness, suggesting the careful weighing of disciplinary actions with empathy and consideration for individual circumstances. This communicates the idea of maintaining discipline while also showing care and empathy towards those involved. It reinforces the concept of discipline not merely as enforcement but as a supportive and nurturing process. 
#### Objectives

We want to imbue in our students with a positive and resilient outlook in life to better prepare them for the future<br>
We seek to enable our students to make informed decisions in life by anchoring their decision making process based on the school’s ANCHOR values<br>
We want to nurture our students to be gracious and responsible citizens who serve the community and country

#### Pedagogical Approaches

Our department employs a variety of teaching methods including explicit teaching of values during dedicated Character and Citizenship lessons and reinforcement &amp; application of learning through a variety of Student Development Experiences (SDE) such as Learning Journeys, CCA, National Education (NE) Commemorative days etc. We believe that values must be ‘caught and taught’ hence, these approaches provide the knowledge and authentic setting for students to learn, reinforce and apply the values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions throughout the school day through various platforms.

#### Key Programmes/Initiatives:

##### School-based:
**Start-The-Year-Right:**<br> This programme is designed to equip students with the habits, skills, dispositions, and mindset to excel in their academic pursuits. We believe that the acquisition of these habits, skills and dispositions are essential to enable our students to become Agile Learners and Gracious Citizens who will thrive in the uncertain and volatile future. Hence, students learn about these habits (e.g. healthy eating, importance of sleep etc) and skills (Lifeskills programme for the respective levels – e.g. financial literacy) are implemented in the first week of school before they resume the usual academic programme from week 2.
