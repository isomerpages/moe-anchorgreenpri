<summary><h4>Cub Scouts</h4></summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
We aim to train our young ones (Cub Scout) by equipping them with the same set of values and skills, both the School and CCA, to be a confident, self-directed person who is an active contributor and a concerned citizen of Singapore – MOE’s Desired outcomes of Education.<br><br>
We engage them with meaningful activities (both indoors and outdoors) in stages to aid them in their development from the moment they take on the CCA to the end of their primary school life.<br><br>
Scouting skills like leadership skill, foot drill, life skills, track and trail, navigation, knotting, knowing the weather, planetary system, nature, and science, arts and crafts, knowing oneself and one’s country,
and many more will teach them to be confident and independent individuals.<br><br>
Scouting is a wholesome CCA that encompasses various skills. The skills learnt, will allow pupils to earn badges from the wide-ranging proficiency skills like gardening, craftsman, navigator etc. Apart from scouting skills, they can also participate in National Campaign courses like World Water Day, and Climate Action Ambassador, which will teach them to be active contributors to the community as well as be concerned citizens.<br><br>

<summary><h4>Floorball (Boys)</h4></summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
AGPS Floorball CCA is a fun and fast-paced sport which requires great teamwork and discipline among the team members. This sport is easy to pick up and one can easily learn in a matter of minutes. However, it requires resilience and determination to excel in this sport. As the students excel in this sport, they will also be given the opportunity to represent the school and participate in the National Schools Floorball Tournament. <br><br>
In Anchor Green Primary School, apart from playing and learning the skills of the game, we also focus on grooming leadership among the students, allowing them to take turns to conduct warm-ups and lead their juniors under the guidance of the coach and teachers-in-charge. Students learn how to communicate effectively, work cooperatively and make responsible decisions. <br><br>
Our floorball alumni also come back during the holidays to impart their knowledge and skills to the next generation of floorball players, as well as role modeling and being an inspiration to the younger players.<br><br>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
Floorball (Girls) was formed in 2016 and has been steadily rising to be one of the top teams in the National Schools Games with consistent performance.<br><br>
The CCA provides opportunities for students to enact the school’s motto of Aspire, Grow and Serve through the various pathways. Through regular participation in the weekly CCA sessions, students <strong>grow</strong> not only in their floorball technical skills but in the CCE21 competencies
such as self-awareness, relationship management, responsible decision making and collaborative skills.<br><br>
Students also <strong>serve</strong> through partnership with APSN (Association for Persons with Special Needs) Chaoyang School where they will train alongside students with mild intellectual disability (MID) and help them to improve their skills. Our students also get to visit the school and learn about the facilities and how different the school setting is as compared to mainstream primary schools. Students in the recreation team will be given the option to participate in Play Inclusive, where teams with students from partnering special and mainstream schools will compete against one another.<br><br>
At the end of the Senior Division NSG season, P6 students also serve by helping the juniors to improve their skills and prepare them for the Junior Division games.<br><br>
For those <strong>aspiring</strong> to join the school team, students will be exposed to additional training and friendly matches with other schools to increase their experience and be a confident player.<br><br>
