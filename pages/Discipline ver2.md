	<summary><strong>Attendance and Punctuality</strong></summary>  
           <ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Daily attendance is compulsory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not send your child to school if he/she is unwell and please
call the school to inform his/her Form teacher of your child’s absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absenteeism must be covered by a Medical Certificate from a doctor OR
a letter with a valid supporting document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A valid Medical Certificate, from a clinic registered with the Singapore
Medical Council, must be submitted to your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher
if he/she has missed any scheduled assessments, when he/she returns to
school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An automated message will be sent to the student’s parent/guardian should
a student be absent from school and if the student’s parent/guardian has
not updated the school on the student’s absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please contact the school’s General Office, as soon as possible, upon
receiving the message to update the school on the reason for your child’s/ward’s
absence and provide the relevant supporting document (e.g. MC) when your
