<p><strong>AG15 Edition – Our Journey&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>In December 2007, Anchor Green Primary School (AGPS) was established to
serve the growing number of young families in the new town of Sengkang.
On 2nd January 2008, AGPS opened along 31 Anchorvale Drive with 9 classes
from Primary One to Three. The total enrolment was 273 pupils then. Mrs
Dhillon Awtar Singh, the founding Principal, led the team of teachers to
build the school. The AGPS identity started to take shape with the newly
minted school crest, school song and motto.</p>
<p>Our school was officially declared open by Dr Lam Pin Min on 2 Oct 2009.
Within a short span of 15 years, a new Indoor Sports Hall was constructed
in the school premises in 2011 while an annex block to house the MOE Kindergarten
was completed under the PERI upgrading project in 2018. The first intake
of MOE Kindergarten pupils began in 2019.</p>

<p>In line with the school’s vision of building a community of aspiring and
gracious learners, AGPS developed environmental programmes and partnered
the National Environment Agency, the Public Utilities Board and IKEA Singapore
to nurture pupils to be environmental stewards. The SLEEC (Serve and Lead
through Environmental Education) programme was established as our Learning
for Life Programme (LLP) in 2014. In 2017, AGPS was accorded the President’s
Award for the Environment, a pinnacle accolade, in recognition of the school’s
continuous efforts in promoting environmental education and awareness amongst
staff, students and the community. The LLP was subsequently established
as the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 2019 - Empowering Learners
to be Environmental Activists (ELEA).</p>

cloth and sewn together with sewing machines generously provided by Brother
International to celebrate SG50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the leadership of our second Principal, Mdm Norliza Bte A. Rahim,
the school continued to strengthen its environmental programmes. In 2016,
AGPS was accorded a second Learning for Life Programme in Aspire, Grow
Passion, Serve through the Arts (AGPS.Arts). The school’s vision from A.G.P.S.
Arts is to develop every Anchorlite to be a Lifelong Learner and a Lifelong
Advocate of the Arts by building upon Anchorlites’ knowledge, skills and
love for the arts, nurturing their creative expressions, enriching their
social, cultural and heritage awareness. The school strives to nurture
them to be confident, critical and creative learners as well as active
contributors to society through a wide spectrum of arts platforms.</p>
<p>With the stewardship of AGPS passing to Mr Wesley Cheong, our third Principal
in 2021, the school celebrated our 15th anniversary in 2023. The “Highs
and Lows” AG15 mural, an artistic collaboration by our Primary One to Six
Anchorlites, was officially launched by our Cluster Superintendent. Concurrently,
the Chairman of the School Advisory Committee opened the Grow and Glow
Room officially as the ‘home’ of our After-School Engagement Programme.
Last but not least, our Zonal Director also launched the AGPS Chinese Language
e-book of good phrases which can be used in composition-writing.</p>
<p>AG15 was also a memorable day of reunions as our ex-Anchorlites returned
to join in the celebration. Netball Anchorlites played an exhibition match
with our invited Netball alumni, who were part of the 2018 Senior Girls’
Team who were crowned National Champion at the National School Games. It
was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the girls and alumni to pit against
one another while demonstrating their skills and appreciation for the game
throughout the exhibition match. These fifteen years have indeed put us
in good stead and together, we will continue to Aspire, Grow and Serve!</p>
