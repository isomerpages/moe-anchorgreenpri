Mathematics @ AGPS
==================

Following closely to the Mathematics Framework by MOE, we aim to equip pupils with the necessary mathematical knowledge and skills for everyday life. To make learning meaningful and effective, teachers capitalize on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach in their teaching. Pupils are encouraged to explore mathematical concepts through hands-on activities using manipulatives, before they are exposed to the pictorial and abstract stages.
