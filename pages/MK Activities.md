prototype new worlds, and explore creative workflows that will help shape
the future of design using both technology and art principles.<br><br>
This CCA aims to provide a foundation in the design and development of
experiences in the exploration of human connection and interaction through
visual arts, media and technology. Furthermore, there is collaboration
with Infocomm Media Authority of Singapore (IMDA) as our P5 and P6 students
are taking part in their learning road map. Students are taught in areas
of podcast. videography, photography as well as simple coding applications
like PICTOBLOX.<br><br>

STEM Innovators in AGPS provides students with an array of experience. The CCA aims to apply Science, technology, engineering and Mathematics to real-life context which engages Anchorlites in problem-solving and coming up with creative and innovative solutions to problems. Anchorlites will be trained in the different technology aspects – coding, 3D designing and programming in creating robots, games and prototypes. This is to provide Anchorlites the experience and empowerment to be creative and innovative in their creations that can be used to solve real-world problems.<br><br>
<strong>Competitions / Events taking part in:</strong><br><br>
<strong>• IDE Robotics Competition</strong><br>
This competition is to design robots to solve a myriad of real world climate change crises. Our teams are expected to adapt their robot build and code to the rules on the competition day based on a pre-programed robot.<br><br>
	<strong>• National Robotics Competition</strong><br>
The teams need to design, construct and program an autonomous robot that can solve specific challenges on a field based on the theme “Green City”.<br><br>
<strong>• National Thinkers Challenge	</strong><br>
This challenge allows opportunity for students to explore how AI can improve our way of life so that they can be active contributors to our society and the community through solving authentic real worlds issues.<br><br>
