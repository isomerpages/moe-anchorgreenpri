<td>Most children have interactions with their family doctors only when they fall sick. This time, the K2 children had their first-hand experience to interview a doctor, Dr Colin Low (Pancare Medical Clinc Hougang) face-to-face to find out how the different organs in their bodies function. They were excited, with some posing more than one question for the doctor. </td>
