Festive Drums CCA was established in 2012. Over the years, the CCA has undergone changes in instructors and members, but what has remained constant is the dedication of its members and teachers. We foster a spirit of cooperation, perseverance, and excellence in students through rigorous rehearsals and performances. The teachers-in-charge and CCA instructors work closely to develop our students to their fullest potential, refining their drumming and performance skills. A festive drummer can anticipate opportunities to perform both within the school and in public, contributing to the community by participating in various events such as the Sengkang West Family Day in 2019 and Arts Outreach @ Seng Kang Community Hospital in 2023. Through our CCA, students also cultivate self-discipline, self-confidence, and a passion for drumming and the performing arts.<br><br><strong>Events taking part in :</strong><br>
