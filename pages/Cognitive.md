The Anchor Green Primary School Chess Club was set up with the objective of promoting intellectual games as well as bringing together enthusiastic chess players. It aims to introduce basic chess skills to members and help them develop their interest in playing chess for recreational purpose. Through learning and playing chess, members develop critical thinking skills and become agile and resilient learners. They are also optimistic learners with the growth mindset, always ready to face challenges while playing friendly matches with different members.<br><br>

Festive Drums CCA was established in 2012. Over the years, the CCA has undergone changes in instructors and members, but what has remained constant is the dedication of its members and teachers. We foster a spirit of cooperation, perseverance, and excellence in students through rigorous rehearsals and performances. The teachers-in-charge and CCA instructors work closely to develop our students to their fullest potential, refining their drumming and performance skills. A festive drummer can anticipate opportunities to perform both within the school and in public, contributing to the community by participating in various events such as the Sengkang West Family Day in 2019 and Arts Outreach @ Seng Kang Community Hospital in 2023. Through our CCA, students also cultivate self-discipline, self-confidence, and a passion for drumming and the performing arts.<br><br><strong>Events taking part in :</strong><br>
