<br>At the core of the framework, the balance symbolises equilibrium and fairness,
suggesting the careful weighing of disciplinary actions with empathy and
consideration for individual circumstances. This communicates the idea
of maintaining discipline while also showing care and empathy towards those
involved. It reinforces the concept of discipline not merely as enforcement
but as a supportive and nurturing process.</p>

<summary><strong>Philosophy:</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>
<br>AGPS believes that discipline should not focus on consequences, but about
fostering a positive learning environment where all students can thrive.
We embrace the concept of "Discipline with CARE," which emphasises guidance,
support, and the development of self-regulation skills. This philosophy
is grounded in the acronym CARE, with restorative practices integrated
throughout:
<br>
<br>• Compassion: We approach students with empathy and understanding, recognizing
that behavior can stem from a variety of factors. We utilise restorative
practices to create a safe space for students to express their feelings
and perspectives when addressing misconduct.
<br>
<br>• Accountability: We hold students accountable for their actions in a
way that promotes reflection and growth. This may involve restorative practices
like conferencing or circles, where students can take ownership of their
behavior and the impact it had on others.
<br>
<br>• Respect: We treat all members of our school community with respect,
fostering positive relationships and a sense of belonging. Restorative
practices, like mediation, encourage respectful dialogue and help rebuild
trust after conflict.
<br>
<br>• Empowerment: We empower students to make positive choices and develop
the skills necessary for self-discipline. Restorative practices provide
opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes, repair harm caused,
and contribute to solutions.</p>

<summary><strong>Approach:</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>
<br>Our school-wide discipline approach focuses on Prevention, Intervention,
and Restoration, with restorative practices woven into the process:
<br>
<br>• Prevention: We actively promote a positive school climate through clear
expectations, positive reinforcement, and student well-being programmes.
Our school-wide approach to enhancing student well-being is further strengthened
by a positive education framework developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, known
as the P.R.O.S.P.E.R framework. This framework empowers students to make
positive choices and thrive both academically and personally.
<br>
<br>• Intervention: We enforce discipline consistently, ensuring fairness.
When misconduct occurs, we prioritise restorative practices as our primary
intervention strategy. Teachers will facilitate conferences or mediations.
This allows students to directly address the harm caused, identify underlying
issues that may have contributed to the behavior, and collaboratively develop
a plan to address the misconduct. This approach ensures we promptly address
inappropriate behavior while also promoting empathy, accountability, and
sustainable positive change. The focus is on helping students develop self-discipline
and good character.
<br>
<br>• Restoration: Restorative practices remain central even when implementing
consequences. Consequences may still be necessary, but they will be chosen
with a restorative lens, such as Behavioural Corrective Duty (BCD) or Reflection
Time (RT) that contribute to repairing the harm. * Students may be required
to participate in conferences or mediation to understand the impact of
their actions and contribute to repairing the harm caused. Teachers will
work with students to replace inappropriate behaviors with prosocial ones
and restore relationships with those impacted by their actions.
<br>
<br>* Disciplinary consequences such as suspension and caning are considered
in combination or separately, depending on the circumstances of each case.</p>
