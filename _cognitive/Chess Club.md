The Anchor Green Primary School Chess Club was set up with the objective of promoting intellectual games as well as bringing together enthusiastic chess players. It aims to introduce basic chess skills to members and help them develop their interest in playing chess for recreational purpose. Through learning and playing chess, members develop critical thinking skills and become agile and resilient learners. They are also optimistic learners with the growth mindset, always ready to face challenges while playing friendly matches with different members.
