## Positive Education (P.R.O.S.P.E.R) 

In line with the school’s vision to develop Agile Learners and Gracious Citizens, the school has adopted Positive Education (PosEd) as a school-wide approach to enhance our students’ well-being and learning. We are guided by the P.R.O.S.P.E.R. Framework, developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, in our implementation. 

PosEd is a prominent feature in our school’s policies and daily practices. Our teachers intentionally teach and imbue elements of positive psychology in their lessons and key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) such as camps and CCAs. This provides students with an immersive experience and helps them become active participants and ambassadors of PosEd, as they live and embody the desired values and dispositions across a wide range of school experiences.

**The P.R.O.S.P.E.R Framework is enacted in the following 7 domains:**

	<tr><td><small><b>Encouraging Positivity</b><br>
<i>We seek to nurture a caring and enabling environment where our Anchorlites cultivate positive emotions through practices that promote joy, graciousness, gratitude, a growth mindset and mindfulness.</i></small>
</td><td>•  We adopt an Outward Mindset where we see others as people, consider and understand their needs, challenges and objectives, and work towards collective results (shared outcomes or goals).<br>
•	 We create a caring and enabling school environment through the enactment of the 5 elements of creating a positive classroom environment. 
</td></tr><tr><td><small><b>Building Relationships</b><br>
<i>We believe that every Anchorlite is a peer supporter committed to building positive relationships. By using positive language and fostering a caring classroom culture, we ensure that every student feels safe, respected, supported and valued.</i></small>
</td><td>•  We cultivate a positive teacher-student relationship (TSR) to improve students’ behaviour, academic success and mental well-being. (e.g. We conduct "Let’s CHAT" sessions, FTGP, Circle Time).<br>
•	We use positive teacher language to communicate with our students, helping to create a supportive and respectful learning environment.<br>
•	We promote a positive peer-student relationship (PSR) where students learn to build social skills and strong bonds between them (e.g. STYR, BTS and ETYR activities).</td></tr>
