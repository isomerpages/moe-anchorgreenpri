## Positive Education (P.R.O.S.P.E.R) 

In line with the school’s vision to develop Agile Learners and Gracious Citizens, the school has adopted Positive Education (PosEd) as a school-wide approach to enhance our students’ well-being and learning. We are guided by the P.R.O.S.P.E.R. Framework, developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, in our implementation. 

PosEd is a prominent feature in our school’s policies and daily practices. Our teachers intentionally teach and imbue elements of positive psychology in their lessons and key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) such as camps and CCAs. This provides students with an immersive experience and helps them become active participants and ambassadors of PosEd, as they live and embody the desired values and dispositions across a wide range of school experiences.

**The P.R.O.S.P.E.R Framework is enacted in the following 7 domains:**
