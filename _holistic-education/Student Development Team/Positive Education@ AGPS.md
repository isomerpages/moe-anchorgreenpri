## Positive Education (P.R.O.S.P.E.R) 

In line with the school’s vision to develop Agile Learners and Gracious Citizens, the school has adopted Positive Education (PosEd) as a school-wide approach to enhance our students’ well-being and learning. We are guided by the P.R.O.S.P.E.R. Framework, developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, in our implementation. 

PosEd is a prominent feature in our school’s policies and daily practices. Our teachers intentionally teach and imbue elements of positive psychology in their lessons and key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) such as camps and CCAs. This provides students with an immersive experience and helps them become active participants and ambassadors of PosEd, as they live and embody the desired values and dispositions across a wide range of school experiences.

**The P.R.O.S.P.E.R Framework is enacted in the following 7 domains:**

**Key Programmes in SDT to promote Positive Education **
<table><tbody>
<tr><td width="30%"><b>Programmes</b></td><td width="70%"><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Start The Year Right (STYR)<br><br>Back to School(BTS)<br><br>End the Year Right (ETYR)
</b></td><td>As we begin each school term with a rejuvenated start, these programmes serve as a whole-school initiative designed to help students begin each school term with a positive mindset. Conducted by Form Teachers during the first week of the term, the programme sets the tone for a purposeful and joyful learning experience ahead.<br><br>
Through a series of interactive activities and class discussions, STYR, BTS and ETYR focus on building positive relationships, strengthening class identity, and encouraging students to reflect on their goals and values as a developmental milestone throughout the year. It also reinforces classroom routines and expectations in a supportive and inclusive way.<br><br>
More importantly, opportunities are created for students to reconnect with their peers and teachers as well as to reignite their joy of learning. By intentionally starting each term and ending the year on a strong and hopeful note, we aim to cultivate a nurturing classroom environment where every child feels safe, motivated, and ready to thrive.<br><br><i><b>Start The Year Right (STYR)</b></i><br><br>

<tr><td><b>Strength-Based approach in Resilience Building</b></td><td> As part of our school’s commitment to nurturing students’ well-being, and in line with one of our student outcomes, <b>Resilient Explorer</b>, we place a strong emphasis on building resilience across all levels by engaging students in reflecting on their strengths and learning how to use them to overcome challenges. Using the <b>"I Am, I Can, I Have"_ Resilience Learning Aid</b>, we guide students in understanding their internal and external strengths that help them bounce back from challenges and grow stronger through setbacks: <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp; "I Am" focuses on helping students recognise their inner strengths—such as being confident, hopeful, and kind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp; "I Can" empowers them with skills—like problem-solving, seeking help, and managing their emotions in healthy ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;"I Have" builds awareness of their support system—such as caring teachers, friends, and family who they can rely on.

Teachers are also equipped with the Resilience Strength Builder \[RSB\] conversation tool to facilitate resilience-fostering conversations. Through structured classroom lessons (FTGP, CCE-MTL), Student Development Experiences (e.g., Camp, CCA), and daily interactions with teachers, students are taught how to tap into these strengths. Whether it’s learning to stay calm during conflicts, celebrating small wins, or identifying trusted adults they can talk to, every child is equipped with the tools to face life’s ups and downs with courage and confidence.

By fostering resilience and optimism, we help our students grow into self-assured individuals who believe in themselves, take initiative, and know they have a supportive network to rely on.<br><br><img src="/images/Curriculum/SDT/Circle_Time.jpg" style="width:100%">Circle Time: Our Primary 3 Anchorlites participated in a Strength-Based Resilience Building Workshop, designed to help them recognise their inner light—and use it to shine through life’s challenges.<br><br><img src="/images/Curriculum/SDT/I_Can_Games.jpg" style="width:100%">‘I Am, I Can, I Have’ games</td></tr>

**Key SDT Programmes by Level in Alignment with Cohort Theme**<br><br>
**Primary 1 – Growth**<br><br>
The level theme for Primary 1 students is **Growth**. Growth focuses on cultivating a belief that abilities can be developed with effort and perseverance, rather than being fixed. Through this theme, we aim to help your child/ward embraces challenges as opportunities to learn and improve.

As part of this journey, your child/ward will be introduced to the concept of a Growth Mindset and how it differs from a Fixed Mindset. Your child/ward will also learn the importance of trying new things, viewing mistakes as valuable learning experiences, and persevering through initial difficulties. To support this, we will teach them positive Growth Mindset language, empowering them to approach learning with confidence and resilience. This foundational mindset lays the groundwork for fostering resilience as they progress through their educational journey.  
  

**Growth Mindset** represents how students believe that their abilities can be developed through effort, practice, and learning, rather than being fixed. It reflects their willingness to embrace challenges and learn from mistakes.

**Primary 2 – Generosity**

The level theme for Primary 2 is **Generosity**. Our students have been making a conscious effort to create a caring and supportive school environment. By sharing kindness and giving affirmations, they are spreading positivity to those around them and making a meaningful difference in each other's lives.

As part of our Primary 2 level theme on Generosity, students participated in a Mystery Book Exchange. By bringing in pre-loved books to swap with their peers, they discovered new stories while putting the values of giving and sharing into practice.

This initiative not only helps to foster a love for reading but also reinforces the lessons of generosity learned in the classroom. Students were so excited to find new stories and give their old books a new home. It was a great way to show them how important it is to be thoughtful and generous members of our school community.

This focus on generosity has helped build a positive classroom culture and is developing our students into thoughtful communicators who are kind and generous in their interactions. We are proud of their efforts to make our school a more supportive and inclusive place for everyone.<br>

**Primary 3 – Graciousness**

The level theme for Primary 3 is **Graciousness**. We hope that through our various programmes and activities planned, our Anchorlites will be able to instill in them the sense of empathy towards others, show act of kindness and improve their emotional well-being.

As part of the level focus, the Primary 3 students participated in Growing Graciousness**:** P3 to P6 Plant Gifting Initiative. This level-wide initiative aims to nurture graciousness in Primary 3 students while promoting environmental responsibility and fostering inter-level bonds within the school community.

Each Primary 3 class will be paired with a corresponding Primary 6 class to cultivate a meaningful act of giving. As a culminating gesture of graciousness, Primary 3 students will write short notes of encouragement or appreciation for their paired Primary 6 students. Through this initiative, students embody the school’s ANCHOR values while fostering a culture of **graciousness, care, and inter-level appreciation**.

In addition, the P3 students put graciousness into action through their participation in the _Food from the Heart_ donation drive. They contributed beautiful and creative artwork to raise awareness for the cause, and the EE Champions led a morning assembly presentation to share this message with the school. This hands-on project allowed students to deepen their understanding of graciousness by working together with their peers and teachers on a meaningful community effort.

**Primary 4 – Gratitude**

The level theme for Primary 4 is **Gratitude**. We hope through our various programmes and activities planned, our Anchorlites will be able to develop in them a sense of gratitude towards others, show their appreciation and thanks to those who supported them in their journey of learning. represents how students learn to express appreciation and recognize the contributions of others. It reflects their ability to foster respect, empathy, and positive relationships in their daily interactions.

Students deepen their understanding of gratitude through level programmes and everyday classroom experiences. Alongside creating heartfelt thank-you tokens for transport staff as part of SBS Transit’s CARE Kindness Month—reflecting on everyday heroes and expressing appreciation, they also engage in classroom discussions, circle time reflections, and activities that encourage them to recognise and appreciate the people and things they are grateful for in their daily lives. These combined experiences help nurture a genuine attitude of thankfulness and kindness.<br><br>

**Primary 5 – Grit**

The level theme for Primary 5 students is **Grit.** Grit represents how students develop passion, determination, perseverance, and a never-give-up attitude. It reflects their ability to face challenges with resilience, stay focused on their goals, and persist through difficulties to achieve success.

A key opportunity to practise grit is the Primary 5 Integrated Project Work (IPW), where students collaborate to solve real-life problems, requiring sustained effort and effective teamwork. Similarly, the Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp provides a structured platform to intentionally strengthen resilience. Guided by the Resilience Learning Aid, teachers facilitate conversations and activities that enhance students’ determination and their ability to persist despite difficulties.

The students also took part in the Learning for Success Workshop. They learned to set SMART goals, apply effective time management techniques, and strengthen their critical thinking skills to make informed decisions. Through interactive team-building activities, students also enhanced their communication, trust, and collaboration with their peers.

Together, these experiences equip students with the mindset and skills to persevere, adapt, and succeed in the face of challenges.<br><br><img src="/images/Curriculum/SDT/Grit.jpg" style="width:100%">P5 students showed great grit throughout their IPW journey, persevering as a team to create this impressive final product.<br><br><img src="/images/Curriculum/SDT/Catapult.jpg" style="width:100%">Building a catapult to promote team-building during P5 camp.
