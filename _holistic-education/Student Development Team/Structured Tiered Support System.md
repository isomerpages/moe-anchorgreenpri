## Structured Tiered Support System - Supporting Students with Additional Needs (SWAN)

<img src="/images/Curriculum/SDT/Structured_Tiered.jpg" style="width:100%">

  Anchor Green Primary School adopts the Tiered System of Support (TSS), a whole-school systemic framework by MOE, in providing support for students and managing school’s resources effectively and efficiently. Special Educational Needs (SEN) Officers and School Counsellor work hand in hand with teachers to provide timely support for SWAN in their learning, behavioural and social-emotional needs.&nbsp;

*   Tier 1 is the core curriculum/ instruction provided to **ALL students** for both academic and non-academic areas. Quality Tier 1 support plays a preventative function by equipping all students with a good foundation in academic and non-academic skills.&nbsp;

*   Tier 2 is early targeted support provided to&nbsp;**SOME**&nbsp;students. SWAN are provided support in their specific areas of need (e.g., academic, behavioural, social-emotional).&nbsp;

*   Tier 3 is intensive targeted support provided to a&nbsp;**FEW**&nbsp;students. who require MORE intensive and individualised intervention.
