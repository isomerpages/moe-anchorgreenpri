### Overview of support provided by SEN and SCs

At Anchor Green Primary School, the **Special Educational Needs Officers (SENOs)** work closely with teachers, parents, external professionals, and students to coordinate tailored learning support for pupils with special educational needs, ensuring they receive the appropriate academic, social, and emotional support. Complementing this, the **School Counsellors (SCs)** provide a safe and supportive environment for students to share their challenges and work through social, emotional, behavioural, and mental health issues. They equip students with strategies to manage their emotions, cope with difficulties, and make positive choices, promoting overall well-being and personal growth.

In AGPS Student Support Services Team, it consists of these 3 support services:<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Learning and Behavioural provided by the Special Educational Needs Officers (SENOs),<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counselling Services provided by the school counsellors<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Welfare provided by the Student Welfare officers\*(SWOs)<br>* While our school does not have a dedicated SWO, a roving officer supports multiple schools by assisting students facing challenges and linking them to appropriate resources and support services.

If your child requires counselling support, there are several ways to make a referral:<br>1.  Your child may approach the **school counsellor** directly during recess or after school.<br>2.  They may also **inform their form teacher**.<br>3.  If your child is uncomfortable doing so, **parents can share their concerns** with the teacher or contact the school via email or phone.

Teachers may also refer students for counselling if they observe that additional socio-emotional support may be needed. Once the Student Support Services team receives a referral, a school counsellor will be assigned to work with your child and will contact you to gather more information. If your child has any medical or mental health diagnoses, please provide the relevant documents to the teacher or counsellor to ensure better support.
