### AGPS Holistic Student Well-being


At AGPS, student well-being is at the heart of what we do. Our framework is built on the belief that **“Every Anchorlite is a Peer Supporter”**, empowering every student to play an active role in creating a supportive and inclusive school environment.

The framework is supported by the 4Cs:

*   **Care** – Nurturing a safe and supportive space for all Anchorlites.
*   **Connect** – Building meaningful teacher-student and peer relationships.
*   **Create** – Encouraging student voice, creativity, and expression.
*   **Collaborate** – Partnering with stakeholders to sustain an enabling environment for all students.

##### Peer Support and Anti-Bullying Initiatives

We foster a supportive community through initiatives such as "Be a Buddy, Not a Bully." Students are encouraged to adopt positive behaviors, recognize bullying, empathize, assist, comfort, and take appropriate action. The "Every Anchorlite is a Peer Supporter" initiative empowers students to cheer their peers, promote acceptance, respect, and speak up against bullying.

This framework focuses on three core pillars:

*   **Physical Health &amp; Well-Being**<br>
Encouraging active lifestyles, promoting health awareness, providing nutritious meals, and instilling healthy routines both at home and in school.

*   **Mental Health &amp; Resilience**<br>
Recognizing emotional challenges as a natural part of growth, we equip students with the C.O.P.E.S. strategy (Calm down, Observe emotions, Positive thinking, Explore options, Seek support) to build resilience and mental wellness.

*   **Cyber Wellness**<br>
Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. It involves an understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviour, an awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users from such behaviour, and a recognition of the power of the Internet to benefit oneself and the community at large.

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

**3 Key Cyber Wellness Messages**

Students to

* embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.<br>
* be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.<br>
* be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.
