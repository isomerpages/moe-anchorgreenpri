### AGPS Holistic Student Well-being


At AGPS, student well-being is at the heart of what we do. Our framework is built on the belief that **“Every Anchorlite is a Peer Supporter”**, empowering every student to play an active role in creating a supportive and inclusive school environment.



The framework is supported by the 4Cs:

*   **Care** – Nurturing a safe and supportive space for all Anchorlites.
*   **Connect** – Building meaningful teacher-student and peer relationships.
*   **Create** – Encouraging student voice, creativity, and expression.
*   **Collaborate** – Partnering with stakeholders to sustain an enabling environment for all students.

##### Peer Support and Anti-Bullying Initiatives

We foster a supportive community through initiatives such as "Be a Buddy, Not a Bully." Students are encouraged to adopt positive behaviors, recognize bullying, empathize, assist, comfort, and take appropriate action. The "Every Anchorlite is a Peer Supporter" initiative empowers students to cheer their peers, promote acceptance, respect, and speak up against bullying.

This framework focuses on three core pillars:

*   **Physical Health & Well-Being**

Encouraging active lifestyles, promoting health awareness, providing nutritious meals, and instilling healthy routines both at home and in school.

*   **Mental Health & Resilience**

Recognizing emotional challenges as a natural part of growth, we equip students with the C.O.P.E.S. strategy (Calm down, Observe emotions, Positive thinking, Explore options, Seek support) to build resilience and mental wellness.
