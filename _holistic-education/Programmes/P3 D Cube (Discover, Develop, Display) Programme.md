P3 D-Cube (Discover, Develop, Display) Programme
===============================

D-Cube Programme seeks to provide our Primary 3 pupils with a breadth of experience in the areas of **A**esthetics, co**G**nitive and **P**hysical domains to discover their interests and talents. Through the six modules, we strive to develop the core foundation in our pupils through a wide variety of learning areas offered through our AGPS Experience. In addition, the programme seeks to support the development of social emotional competencies while providing a platform for friendships and social integration of students from diverse backgrounds.
