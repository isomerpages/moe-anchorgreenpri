<p>The school aims to provide support and focused teaching to the low progress
students so that they are able to build a solid foundation, and their learning
gaps are addressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whilst MOE has come up with a wide suite of learning support programmes
for most of the subjects from P1 to P4, the school acknowledges that the
learning gap of the P5 and P6 students will get wider if they are not looked
into.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An identification process is done to select the students, and diagnostic
tests are conducted, followed by remediation and thereafter, post diagnostic
tests are carried out to ensure that the learning gaps are closed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To ensure that the students remain motivated and that their well-being
is taken care of, students taking Foundation Math and Foundation English
subjects are not required to attend this programme. Students attend only
their two weakest subjects every Monday, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
