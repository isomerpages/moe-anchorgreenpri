As part of the school’s new strategic initiative, which is to adopt a whole-school approach for an AGPS Experience TALENT Development Programme, this programme aims to build on the talent and interest in our P4 to P6 students.

Various programmes (MOE-initiated or school-based) are carried out to further deepen students’ passion and love for the subject. These activities allow the students to display their CAI (Critical, Adaptive and Inventive) Thinking and CCI (Communication, Collaboration and Information) Skills.

To ensure that there is a balance for the languages and Math and Sciences, selected students are given opportunities to opt for a language TDP on Mondays, and/or a Math or Science TDP on Tuesdays. Both programmes run for an hour, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.
