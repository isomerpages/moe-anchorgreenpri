Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
===================================

### ANCHORLITES’ DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE SKILLS

The Programme for Active Learning, also known as PAL, is one of MOE PERI’s recommendations to address the increased emphasis on holistic education and development of life skills. It provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school child to primary education.

  

PAL emphasizes learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. In PAL lessons, ANCHORLITES will be actively participating in a range of activities through four domains i.e. **VISUAL ARTS**, **SPORTS/GAMES**, **OUTDOOR EDUCATION** and **PERFORMING ARTS**. Through the four domains, opportunities will be given for students to work individually and with others, create and express their thoughts and feelings, make decisions, and reflect on their experiences and learning.

  

These experiences will help ANCHORLITES develop a greater awareness of themselves and that of the environment. They will discover new interests, learn new skills, forge new friendships, develop their confidence and character.
