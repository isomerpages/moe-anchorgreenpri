Physical Education
==================

#### Focus
Physical Education (PE) in AGPS is guided by MOEâ€™s Revised PE and Sports Development Framework which advocates a whole-school approach towards development of Anchorlites in Sports and Outdoor Education. Anchorlites are presented with an environment to build a strong foundation for continual growth that leads to improved physical, social and emotional health. Opportunities are created to acquire fundamental motor skills, to be exposed to a variety of sporting experiences, to participate recreationally in physical activities and to pursue competitively in the areas they excel in.

#### Pedagogical Approaches
Through PE, Achorlites develop soft skills with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills. The activities in PE also help Anchorlites deepen their 21st century competencies through a combination of applied learning experiences and life-skills experiences.
