Physical Education
==================

### The Anchorlite Physical Domain  

Physical Education (PE) in AGPS is guided by MOE’s Revised PE and Sports Development Framework which advocates a whole-school approach towards development of pupils in Sports and Outdoor Education. ANCHORLITES are presented with an environment to build a strong foundation for continual growth that leads to improved physical, social and emotional health. Opportunities are created for ANCHORLITES to acquire fundamental motor skills, to be exposed to a variety of sporting experiences, to participate recreationally in physical activities and to pursue competitively in the areas they excel in.

Through PE, ANCHORLITES develop soft skills with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills. The activities in PE also help ANCHORLITES deepen their 21st century competencies through a combination of applied learning experiences and life-skills experiences.
