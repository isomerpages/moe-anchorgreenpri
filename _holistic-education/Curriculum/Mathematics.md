Mathematics
===========

### Focus

To develop pupils with **confidence**, **passion** and **determination** to achieve excellence in mathematics

  

### Objectives

To create **meaningful learning experiences** which help pupils:

*   acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills,
*   develop cognitive and metacognitive skills, and
*   develop positive attitudes towards mathematics

  

### Pedagogy Approaches

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach, based on Jerome Bruner's conception of enactive, iconic and symbolic modes of representation, is the main pedagogical approach use in AGPS's math classrooms.

  

### Key Programmes

**Wow! Wow! Math!**
is a programme which promotes learning of Mathematics in a different and engaging way. It was held over a week and the activities of each days are based on the sub-theme of Whole Numbers, Geometry, Measurement, Logic and Online Games. With the help of our ever supportive PSG, the activities were successfully run and they helped pupils see how Mathematics is closely related to their everyday lives.

Mathematics @ AGPS
==================

Following closely to the Mathematics Framework by MOE, we aim to equip pupils with the necessary mathematical knowledge and skills for everyday life. To make learning meaningful and effective, teachers capitalize on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach in their teaching. Pupils are encouraged to explore mathematical concepts through hands-on activities using manipulatives, before they are exposed to the pictorial and abstract stages.
