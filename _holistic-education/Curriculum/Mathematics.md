Mathematics
===========

### Focus

To develop pupils with **confidence**, **passion** and **determination** to achieve excellence in mathematics

  

### Objectives

To create **meaningful learning experiences** which help pupils:

*   acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills,
*   develop cognitive and metacognitive skills, and
*   develop positive attitudes towards mathematics

  

### Pedagogy Approaches

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach, based on Jerome Bruner's conception of enactive, iconic and symbolic modes of representation, is the main pedagogical approach use in AGPS's math classrooms.
