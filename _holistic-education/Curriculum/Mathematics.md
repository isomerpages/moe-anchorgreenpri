Mathematics
===========

##### Focus

The Mathematics Department is committed to develop pupils with confidence, passion and determination to achieve excellence in mathematics. 

  

##### Objectives

To create **meaningful learning experiences** which help pupils:

*   acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills,
*   develop cognitive and metacognitive skills, and
*   develop positive attitudes towards mathematics

##### Pedagogy Approaches

Our department employs a variety of teaching methods including the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach, Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) and the use of technology (e-pedagogy).  
##### Framework:

##### Key Programmes/Initiatives

##### MOE-initiated:  

**P4 to P6 E2K (Excellence 2000)** <br>
The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking. 

**LSM (Learning Support for Mathematics)** <br>
The LSM Programme aims to provide support and build confidence in students who need more time to develop their numeracy skills. The school offers LSM to our P1 to P4 students. ![Learning Support for Mathematics](/images/Curriculum/Mathematics/LSM.jpg)

**ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy)** <br>
The ICAN Programme aims to help low progress students who do not have a good understanding and mastery of fundamental mathematics concepts and skills. The school offers ICAN to our P3 and P4 students. 

##### School-based:

**Curious Mathematician Trail**  <br>
The AGPS Curious Mathematician Trail aims to give students the opportunity to apply Math to the world around them. Physical or virtual activities are designed to allow students to work collaboratively and engage in rich classroom discussions.

**Math Around Us Home Activities** <br>
The Math Around Us Home Activities Programme aims to provide opportunities for students to bond with their parents through interesting activities that can be carried out at home . This allows students to apply and extend their learning beyond the classroom context.

**P4 Math Project Competition and P5 Math Game Design Competition**<br>
These competitions aim to provide opportunities for students to extend their learning beyond the classroom, apply Mathematics in daily life, and encourage students to do innovative and creative work in Mathematics. ![Math Poster Design](/images/Curriculum/Mathematics/P4_Math_Poster_Design.jpg)![P5 Math Game Design](/images/Curriculum/Mathematics/P5_Math_Game_Design.jpg)

**P5 Math Olympiad Training** <br>
Students who possess exceptional problem-solving skills are selected to participate, with the objective to expose them to challenging questions in order to stimulate their interest and ignite their passion in Mathematics. 

**P5 &amp; P6 Level Up Programme (LUP)**
<br>
Held after school for P5 to P6 Standard Math students, this programme aims to narrow the learning gaps of our low progress students by remediating their areas of weakness in a smaller class size context.
