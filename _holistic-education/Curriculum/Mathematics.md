Mathematics
===========

### Focus

To develop pupils with **confidence**, **passion** and **determination** to achieve excellence in mathematics

  

### Objectives

To create **meaningful learning experiences** which help pupils:

*   acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills,
*   develop cognitive and metacognitive skills, and
*   develop positive attitudes towards mathematics

  

### Pedagogy Approaches

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach, based on Jerome Bruner's conception of enactive, iconic and symbolic modes of representation, is the main pedagogical approach use in AGPS's math classrooms.

  

### Key Programmes

**Wow! Wow! Math!**
is a programme which promotes learning of Mathematics in a different and engaging way. It was held over a week and the activities of each days are based on the sub-theme of Whole Numbers, Geometry, Measurement, Logic and Online Games. With the help of our ever supportive PSG, the activities were successfully run and they helped pupils see how Mathematics is closely related to their everyday lives.

**Curious Mathematician Trail**  <br>
The AGPS Curious Mathematician Trail aims to provide students with the opportunity to apply Math to their school environment. Students embark on a virtual tour around the school and engage in classroom discussions and activities on how math is related to the school environment.

**Math Around Us Home Activities** <br>
The Math Around Us Home Activities aim to provide opportunities for students to extend and apply learning beyond the classroom. It aims to develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics and encourage parent-child bonding.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K)**<br>
The Excellence 2000 programme aims to develop pupils’ independent learning, higher-order thinking and creativity. While providing pupils with the empowerment to learn, this programme strengthens our pupils’ confidence and reinforces their perceptions of self as an independent learner and investigator. All this is done while developing effective personal and cognitive skills and strengthening a love for learning.

**LSM and ICAN** <br>
The LSM and ICAN programmes aim to support students’ confidence in Mathematics through building their foundation of mathematics concepts which are keys to deeper understanding and learning. With a stronger foundation, students' cognitive loads are lessened, significantly allowing them to focus more on problem-solving.

**P4 Math Project Competition and P5 Math Game Design Competition**
<br>
Primary 4 students are to submit a poster on how Mathematics is applied in the daily lives, while P5 students tap on ICT Tools to collaborate and create a board game. This learning experience aims to provide student with the opportunity to apply mathematical concepts and for students to show their creativity and innovation.

Mathematics @ AGPS
==================

Following closely to the Mathematics Framework by MOE, we aim to equip pupils with the necessary mathematical knowledge and skills for everyday life. To make learning meaningful and effective, teachers capitalize on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach in their teaching. Pupils are encouraged to explore mathematical concepts through hands-on activities using manipulatives, before they are exposed to the pictorial and abstract stages.
