Social Studies
==============


### Vision

To nurture pupils as informed, concerned and participative citizens who make informed decisions for the benefit of nation and community

  

### Objectives

At AGPS, we seek to:

*   Ignite pupils’ curiosity and inquire into real-world, global issues that concerns Singapore;
*   Develop pupils’ critical and reflective thinking skills and to appreciate multiple perspectives; and
*   Nurture pupils’ dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrates empathy in their relationships with others

  

### Pedagogical Approach

Inquiry approach is the pedagogy adopted for the implementation of the Social Studies syllabus. It provides pupils with learning experiences that are engaging and relevant to them as well as equipping pupils with the knowledge, skills and values that would enable them to succeed at becoming effective citizens, professionals and leaders in the 21st century. Through inquiry-based learning, pupils are involved in investigating, inquiring and reflection so that they will better understand the inter-connectedness of the knowledge gained and application in the real world.

  

### Key Programmes

Anchorlites embark on National Education (NE) learning journeys to contextualize their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting. They experience hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus being engaged in multi-sensory modes and make connections to the topic being studied. 

The NE Learning Journeys at the different levels are listed in the table below:
