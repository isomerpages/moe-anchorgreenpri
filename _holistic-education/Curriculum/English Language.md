English Language
================
### Focus
A Community of Confident and Competent English Learners
### Objectives
*   To nurture confident and effective communicators with the love for the language
*   We strive on building a strong foundation of the English Language through students’ enjoyment of the language and the promotion of reading, oracy and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language. 

### Pedagogy Approaches
The school adopts **STELLAR** (**ST**rategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning **A**nd **R**eading) in the teaching of English Language. STELLAR strengthens students’ language and reading skills and promotes a positive attitude towards learning using stories and strategies to engage students in the learning of English Language.
