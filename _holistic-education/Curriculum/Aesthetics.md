### Focus

Arts Education at AGPS, a.k.a.&nbsp;**A.G.P.S. Arts (Aspire, Grow, Passion and Serve through the Arts)**&nbsp;plays an integral part in the Holistic Education of Each Child; by which achievement in Arts is part of the broader definition of success of each individual.  

The school’s vision from&nbsp;**A.G.P.S. Arts**&nbsp;is to develop every Anchorlite to be a Lifelong Learner and a Lifelong Advocate of the Arts by building upon our pupils' knowledge, skills and love for the arts, nurturing their creative expressions, enriching their social, cultural and heritage awareness and growing them to be confident, critical and creative learners and active contributors to society through a wide spectrum of arts platforms.

  

### Objectives

We aim to have our Anchorlites be developed as Lifelong Learners and Lifelong Advocates of the Arts who:  

1.  See inter-relationships among ideas, adapt, generate and create new ideas and products
2.  Are encouraged to express their thoughts, form opinions and appreciate differing perspectives
3.  Have an overall development of social skills (value diversity in ideas, confidence building)
4.  Foster appreciation of Singapore cultural heritage
5.  Strengthen understanding of own national identity and ethnic culture

### Key Programmes

The experiences extend from the school’s art and music curriculum as an exposure for all, to Anchorlites who are passionate in the arts and those in Performing and Visual Arts CCAs.

**Say It Art Loud!**

Say It Art Loud! is an Art sharing platform meant for anyone who is passionate about Art and is excited to share with others about their ideas and artwork. All Anchorlites, family members, as well as staff of AGPS are most welcome to share their passion in art through this termly platform. Say It Art Loud! aims to provide our budding artists the opportunity to share their art experiences with their peers and thus, boosting their confidence.

**Everyone Can Perform!**

Everyone Can Perform! provides an opportunity for Anchorlites to take the stage together as a class to perform on the Guzheng, Ukulele and Ethnic percussion instruments during recess. Through Everyone Can Perform!, Anchorlites get the opportunity to showcase and share what they have learnt during the instrumental programmes - in terms of character values, interesting facts and reflections on the preparation journey for the class performance.  

**Unplugged Fridays/Plugged-in Fridays **&nbsp;

Unplugged Fridays/Plugged-in Fridays(online) is an informal Performing Arts platform for pupils and family members, as well as AGPS staff. It is meant for all who are interested to share their passion in anything performance, be it rapping, beatboxing, singing, dancing or playing music instruments.

Plugged-in Fridays is held online on Student Learning Space (SLS), and performances will be available for viewing from the 4th Friday of every month from January to October, after which Anchorlites will vote for their favourite performances. Selected ones from each month will be featured on the school's Facebook page. To further provide opportunities for every Anchorlite to be Advocates of the Arts, the best performances will be shortlisted to perform live for Unplugged Fridays! in school! 
 

**Music and Art Celebrate!**

Music and Art Celebrate! (MAC!) is an annual Aesthetics event that exposes the school population to the Arts, uniting the school as one community as parents, staff and pupils share our passion or be drawn into other Anchorlites' love for the Art and Music. While the theme changes yearly, it always focuses on real-life application, i.e. Arts with a Purpose - the role of the arts, the role of the artists and artistes as well as the role of their art and music works. Students have learnt and will continue to learn how Art and Music are two of the many ways to influence people’s behaviours and beliefs, and that artists and musicians through their artworks and songs on sustainability can inspire, recruit, and explain their positions.

Through the opportunities of learning and engagement in the Arts,&nbsp;**A.G.P.S. Arts Programme**&nbsp;strives to Nurture Talents, Develop Character and Groom pupils to be Leaders so that Anchorlites can contribute to the community, in line with the school motto of Aspire, Grow and Serve.
