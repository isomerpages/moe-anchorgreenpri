<summary><h4>• Discipline Philosophy and Approach</h4>
	</summary><h5>Framework:</h5>

At the core of the framework, the balance symbolises equilibrium and fairness, suggesting the careful weighing of disciplinary actions with empathy and consideration for individual circumstances. This communicates the idea of maintaining discipline while also showing care and empathy towards those involved. It reinforces the concept of discipline not merely as enforcement but as a supportive and nurturing process. 
<h5>Philosophy:</h5>
AGPS believes that discipline should not focus on consequences, but about fostering a positive learning environment where all students can thrive. We embrace the concept of "Discipline with CARE," which emphasises guidance, support, and the development of self-regulation skills. This philosophy is grounded in the acronym CARE, with restorative practices integrated throughout:<br><br>
•	Compassion: We approach students with empathy and understanding, recognizing that behavior can stem from a variety of factors. We utilise restorative practices to create a safe space for students to express their feelings and perspectives when addressing misconduct.<br><br>
•	Accountability: We hold students accountable for their actions in a way that promotes reflection and growth. This may involve restorative practices like conferencing or circles, where students can take ownership of their behavior and the impact it had on others.<br><br>
• Respect: We treat all members of our school community with respect, fostering positive relationships and a sense of belonging. Restorative practices, like mediation, encourage respectful dialogue and help rebuild trust after conflict.<br><br>
•	Empowerment: We empower students to make positive choices and develop the skills necessary for self-discipline. Restorative practices provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes, repair harm caused, and contribute to solutions.
<h5>Approach:</h5>
Our school-wide discipline approach focuses on Prevention, Intervention, and Restoration, with restorative practices woven into the process:<br><br>
•	Prevention: We actively promote a positive school climate through clear expectations, positive reinforcement, and student well-being programmes. Our school-wide approach to enhancing student well-being is further strengthened by a positive education framework developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, known as the P.R.O.S.P.E.R framework. This framework empowers students to make positive choices and thrive both academically and personally. <br><br>
•	Intervention: We enforce discipline consistently, ensuring fairness. When misconduct occurs, we prioritise restorative practices as our primary intervention strategy.  Teachers will facilitate conferences or mediations.  This allows students to directly address the harm caused, identify underlying issues that may have contributed to the behavior, and collaboratively develop a plan to address the misconduct.  This approach ensures we promptly address inappropriate behavior while also promoting empathy, accountability, and sustainable positive change. The focus is on helping students develop self-discipline and good character. <br><br>
•	Restoration: Restorative practices remain central even when implementing consequences. Consequences may still be necessary, but they will be chosen with a restorative lens, such as Behavioural Corrective Duty (BCD) or Reflection Time (RT) that contribute to repairing the harm. * Students may be required to participate in conferences or mediation to understand the impact of their actions and contribute to repairing the harm caused. Teachers will work with students to replace inappropriate behaviors with prosocial ones and restore relationships with those impacted by their actions. <br><br>
<small>*Disciplinary consequences such as suspension and caning are considered in combination or separately, depending on the circumstances of each case.</small><br><br>
