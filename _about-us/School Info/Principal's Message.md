Spend some time at Anchor Green, and you'll notice how deeply we care for our students. We believe **All** our children hold **Great** potential to make **Positive** impact on **Society**.

Our name well epitomizes our passion - a school **Anchored** in our nation's **Green** movement. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), **Empowering Learners** to be **Environmental Activists** (ELEA), empowers every Anchorlite to take ownership. They connect their 3As - (Attitudes, Awareness, Actions) to creatively solve authentic issues to care for the environment. In recognition of our contributions towards sustainability and building a resilient future, we were awarded the President's Award for the Environment, a pinnacle accolade, in 2017.

Our Anchorlites enjoy rich learning experiences across 4 AGPS Domains - **Aesthetic, coGnitive, Physical, Socio-moral Emotional**. We desire that each child discovers and develops his or her unique blend of interests and aptitudes, and thrive as gracious contributors to the community. To illustrate, our **Aspire, Grow Passion, Serve through the ARTS** Learning for Life Programme (LLP) leverages a holistic Arts Education to build character and strong mastery of fundamentals. 

We value our strong partnerships. They expand learning beyond the classroom and even beyond Singapore. We invite all our parents to join the [Parents Support Group](/partners/parent-support-group-psg), as we endeavour to bring out the best in every child together.

We invite you to join us, hoist Anchor, and set sail on an exciting journey of discovery and learning. Together, we **Aspire**, **Grow** and **Serve**!

  

**Mr. Wesley Cheong** 

**Principal**
