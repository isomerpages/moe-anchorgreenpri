The MOE Group Personal Accident Insurance for students related to all school activities and/or co-curricular activities (CCAs) both in and out of school has been arranged for every student. The school’s GPA Plan is with NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited.<br>
**3. Counselling for Pupils – HOD CCE**<br>Pupils who may have academic or behavioural difficulties may be referred to the Case Management Team (CMT). The team members will work with the pupil and teachers to implement supportive strategies to best support the child. Parental consent will be sought prior to the referral to Educational Psychologist (EP) to take up the case.&nbsp;<br>
**4.  Personal Responsibility**<br>&nbsp;We hope to instill personal responsibility in our students, hence students are expected to take responsibility of their own belongings. We seek your support in reinforcing the message and helping our students develop into responsible individuals.&nbsp;<br>
**5. Talent Development and Level Up Programmes – HOD ICT/HOD MA**<br>&nbsp;Students who are identified to remain in school for the above-mentioned programmes are required to attend the programmes, unless parental opt out is exercised. Parents are to ensure that their child attends the lessons and have sufficient pocket money to take their lunch.
