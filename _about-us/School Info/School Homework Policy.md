School Homework Policy
======================

<b>Homework refers to any learning activity in curricular subjects that school requires students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual/ online).</b>  

<b>Examples of homework</b>
* Pen and paper assignments (e.g. practice questions, essays, etc.)
* e-learning assignments (e.g. SLS lessons, recording of oral practices, etc.)
* Flipped classroom learning (e.g. watching assigned video, online lesson resources, etc)
* Alternative assessments (e.g. project work, performance task, etc.)

**No Written Weekend Homework for P1 – P3 pupils**

There will be no written weekend homework for all P1 to P3 pupils. The dual objectives are to allow our pupils to enjoy their weekends with their family and afford them the space and time for parents to think of innovative ways to teach and engage their children.
