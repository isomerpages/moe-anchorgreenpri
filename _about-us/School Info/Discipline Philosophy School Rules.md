<h2>Discipline Philosophy and School Rules</h2>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><h4>• Discipline Philosophy and Approach</h4><br>
</summary><br><h5>Framework:</h5>
<img style="width: 30%" height="auto" width="30%" alt="School Uniform" src="/images/Discipline/Discipline_Framework.jpg"><br>
At the core of the framework, the balance symbolises equilibrium and fairness, suggesting the careful weighing of disciplinary actions with empathy and consideration for individual circumstances. This communicates the idea of maintaining discipline while also showing care and empathy towards those involved. It reinforces the concept of discipline not merely as enforcement but as a supportive and nurturing process. 
<h5>Philosophy:</h5>
AGPS believes that discipline should not focus on consequences, but about fostering a positive learning environment where all students can thrive. We embrace the concept of "Discipline with CARE," which emphasises guidance, support, and the development of self-regulation skills. This philosophy is grounded in the acronym CARE, with restorative practices integrated throughout:<br><br>
•	Compassion: We approach students with empathy and understanding, recognizing that behavior can stem from a variety of factors. We utilise restorative practices to create a safe space for students to express their feelings and perspectives when addressing misconduct.<br><br>
•	Accountability: We hold students accountable for their actions in a way that promotes reflection and growth. This may involve restorative practices like conferencing or circles, where students can take ownership of their behavior and the impact it had on others.<br><br>
• Respect: We treat all members of our school community with respect, fostering positive relationships and a sense of belonging. Restorative practices, like mediation, encourage respectful dialogue and help rebuild trust after conflict.<br><br>
•	Empowerment: We empower students to make positive choices and develop the skills necessary for self-discipline. Restorative practices provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes, repair harm caused, and contribute to solutions.
<h5>Approach:</h5>
Our school-wide discipline approach focuses on Prevention, Intervention, and Restoration, with restorative practices woven into the process:<br><br>
•	Prevention: We actively promote a positive school climate through clear expectations, positive reinforcement, and student well-being programmes. Our school-wide approach to enhancing student well-being is further strengthened by a positive education framework developed by Noble &amp; McGrath, known as the P.R.O.S.P.E.R framework. This framework empowers students to make positive choices and thrive both academically and personally. <br><br>
•	Intervention: We enforce discipline consistently, ensuring fairness. When misconduct occurs, we prioritise restorative practices as our primary intervention strategy.  Teachers will facilitate conferences or mediations.  This allows students to directly address the harm caused, identify underlying issues that may have contributed to the behavior, and collaboratively develop a plan to address the misconduct.  This approach ensures we promptly address inappropriate behavior while also promoting empathy, accountability, and sustainable positive change. The focus is on helping students develop self-discipline and good character. <br><br>
•	Restoration: Restorative practices remain central even when implementing consequences. Consequences may still be necessary, but they will be chosen with a restorative lens, such as Behavioural Corrective Duty (BCD) or Reflection Time (RT) that contribute to repairing the harm. * Students may be required to participate in conferences or mediation to understand the impact of their actions and contribute to repairing the harm caused. Teachers will work with students to replace inappropriate behaviors with prosocial ones and restore relationships with those impacted by their actions. <br><br>
<small>*Disciplinary consequences such as suspension and caning are considered in combination or separately, depending on the circumstances of each case.</small><br><br>

<summary><h4>• Our School Rules</h4>
</summary>
<strong>1. General Conduct</strong><br>
Students are expected to:<br>
<nobr>• Exhibit the <strong> A.N.C.H.O.R.</strong> values - Agility, iNtegrity, Care, Humility, Optimism and Resilience<br>
• Be polite and well-behaved in and outside of school.<br>
• Greet all members of Anchor Green Primary School community – teachers, non-teaching staff, parents and visitors politely.<br>
• Move quietly in an orderly manner when moving around the school.<br>
• Handle all school equipment and property with care.<br>
• Keep the classrooms and school premises clean<br>
• Observe safety guidelines and behave in a safe manner<br><br>

<strong>2. Attendance and Punctuality</strong><br>
• Daily attendance is compulsory.
• Please do not send your child to school if he/she is unwell and please call the school to inform his/her Form teacher of your child’s absence.<br>
• Absenteeism must be covered by a Medical Certificate from a doctor OR a letter with a valid supporting document.<br>
• A valid Medical Certificate, from a clinic registered with the Singapore Medical Council, must be submitted to your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher if he/she has missed any scheduled assessments, when he/she returns to school.<br>
• An automated message will be sent to the student’s parent/guardian should a student be absent from school and if the student’s parent/guardian has not updated the school on the student’s absence.<br>
• Please contact the school’s General Office, as soon as possible, upon receiving the message to update the school on the reason for your child’s/ward’s absence and provide the relevant supporting document (e.g. MC) when your child/ward returns to school.<br>
• Students are to report at the assembly venue for flag raising by 7.20 am.<br>
• Students who arrive at the assembly area after 7.30am will be marked as ‘Late’.<br>
• Students are to participate and be punctual for school and all designated school activities.<br>
• Students must complete the full school term. Prolonged and frequent absence from school will hamper a child’s learning and development. In addition, this may have an impact on his/her Holistic Development Profile (HDP) Report unless the absence is due to valid reason(s) (e.g. Medical Leave).<br>
• Students’ Holistic Development Profile (HDP) and Conduct Grade (CG) report will also be affected should he/ she not adhere to the above-mentioned rules relating to attendance and punctuality.<br><br>

• No food and sweet drinks are to be consumed in the classroom except during the prescribed snack time. Only plain water is allowed to be consumed in class.<br>
• All students will proceed to the canteen during recess.  They are not to stay in the classroom.<br>
• Students will require the teacher’s permission before stepping out of the classroom.<br><br>
<strong>5. Attire and Appearance</strong><br>
