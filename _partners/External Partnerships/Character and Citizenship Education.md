AGPS has partnered family central for this programme since 2013. This partnership enables our students to serve and engage our seniors. Our students do so by teaching the seniors skills such as Information Technology, Building a Terrarium, Line Dancing and through these interaction, our seniors share their life experiences with our students. Our students have gained much from serving and interacting with the seniors and these have also helped them better engage and appreciate their grandparents.

AGPS has partnered CNB for the first time to provide students with a look into this career. CNB gave an assembly presentation to our students on what role does a CNB officer play, as well as advice students on the harmful effects of drugs, etc. Students were also given a chance to head down to their headquarters to have a look into their day to day experience in the office.
