The partnership with NEA was established in 2008 when the school first set its goal of being an EE school. Over the years, the school has worked with them to host the Clean & Green Schools Carnival, the Eco-school Challenge competition where the team came in first in 2012, and to support them to be one of the first 10 schools to introduce the food waste recycling project, Love Your Food in the school.
