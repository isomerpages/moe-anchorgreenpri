The partnership with NEA was established in 2008 when the school first set its goal of being an EE school. Over the years, the school has worked with them to host the Clean & Green Schools Carnival, the Eco-school Challenge competition where the team came in first in 2012, and to support them to be one of the first 10 schools to introduce the food waste recycling project, Love Your Food in the school.

With the Sengkang Floating Wetland located with close proximity to the school, AGPS became one of the schools in the neighbourhood to adopt the Punggol Reservoir. Over the years, we have worked with PUB to infuse Water Education in the school, with each level learning a new concept on water conservation. The school also conducted the Sengkang Floating Wetland Trail for pre-schoolers prior to Covid 19 with the support from PUB.
