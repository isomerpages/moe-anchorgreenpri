In support of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), Anchor Green Primary has worked with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resource (MEWR) to co-brand the Sustainable Singapore Movement (SSM) with the school’s environmental activities. 

  

We have a number of activities to show our support:

1)  Held assembly talks to educate pupils on what are the causes and impacts of climate change. 

2) Crafted our P3 Digital Trail to include a segment on climate change to get students to recap and also learn more about climate change.
