<h1>External Partnerships</h1>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>With the emphasis on building partnerships in our education system since
the 2015 Work Plan Seminar, Anchor Green Primary School recognises that
collaborations with parents, alumni, external organisations, and the community
can contribute to the holistic development of students by incorporating
a broader range of skills, experiences, and perspectives.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>In Anchor Green Primary School, we aim to nurture partnerships that enhance
and support the school’s vision of “Agile Learners, Gracious Citizens”
through collaborations, experiences, and community involvement.</p>
<p>The school aims to facilitate collaborations with local communities and
organisations to enrich the learning environment and provide students with
diverse experiences.</p>
