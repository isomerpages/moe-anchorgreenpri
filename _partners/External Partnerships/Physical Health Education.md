AGPS has partnered SHF and Anchorvale CC to carry out a blood pressure monitoring screening for the public. This is to inculcate in students the awareness of good blood pressure readings as important numbers in their lives and to motivate positive behavioural changes towards better heart health. This also provides out students with opportunity to serve the community.
