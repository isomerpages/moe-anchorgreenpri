<h1>Dads for Life</h1>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>With the emphasis on building partnerships in our education system since
the 2015 Work Plan Seminar, Anchor Green Primary School recognises that
collaborations with parents, alumni, external organisations, and the community
can contribute to the holistic development of students by incorporating
a broader range of skills, experiences, and perspectives.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>In Anchor Green Primary School, we aim to nurture partnerships that enhance
and support the school’s vision of “Agile Learners, Gracious Citizens”
through collaborations, experiences, and community involvement.</p>
<p>The school aims to encourage and facilitate increased parental engagement
in the educational process, tapping on their expertise and experiences
to enrich students’ learning.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes/Initiatives</h4>
<p><strong>School-based:</strong>
</p>
<p>Dads for Life is a national fathers' movement dedicated to inspiring,
mobilising, and engaging fathers to become positive influences in their
children's lives—for life! Research shows that active fatherhood leads
to better cognitive, emotional, and academic development in children. Dads
for Life stresses the long-term effects of involved fatherhood, which can
strengthen relationships, reduce maternal stress, and enhance fathers'
self-identity, benefiting the entire family.</p>
