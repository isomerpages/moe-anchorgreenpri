Parent Support Group (PSG)
=====================
  
#### Focus 

With the emphasis on building partnerships in our education system since the 2015 Work Plan Seminar, Anchor Green Primary School recognises that collaborations with parents, alumni, external organisations, and the community can contribute to the holistic development of students by incorporating a broader range of skills, experiences, and perspectives.

#### Objectives
In Anchor Green Primary School, we aim to nurture partnerships that enhance and support the school’s vision of “Agile Learners, Gracious Citizens” through collaborations, experiences, and community involvement.

The school aims to encourage and facilitate increased parental engagement in the educational process, tapping on their expertise and experiences to enrich students’ learning.

#### Key Programmes/Initiatives
•	The PSG collaborates actively with the school by supporting school activities to provide a holistic growing environment for the students. <br>
•	The PSG provides a network of support and link for the school, families, and the community, as members come from diverse backgrounds and possess varied skills and experiences.<br>
•	The PSG enhances better connection/ link between the school and parents by conducting activities that promote bonding between parents and school, and parents and children.
