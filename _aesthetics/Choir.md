Students who are passionate about choral singing are encouraged to join the Choir. Choristers are provided with the opportunity to sing songs of different genres, repertoire, and even languages. In recent years, students are also encouraged to compose a soundscape as part of their performance.

  

Here in AGPS Choir, the 5 Ps are emphasized: Posture, Part, Precision, Pronunciation, and Phrasing. During each practice session, choristers also do warm-ups including breathing techniques and lip trills, and simple physical activities to develop proper singing techniques.Â 

  

Selected students are chosen to represent the school at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), a national platform for schools in Singapore. Through the training and performance sessions, choristers develop confidence, self-awareness, and self-management skills, and learn to be active contributors.

Primary 4 students had a Values-in-Action session with seniors from an external organization. Not only did they teach the adults to sing, but they also performed pretty confidently in front of them!
