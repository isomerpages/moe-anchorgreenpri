AGPS Handbells Ensemble was established in 2009 and it is a place that provides opportunities for members with different musical abilities to showcase their talent, hone their musical skills, and to make music together.

  

Each member in the ensemble is responsible for 2 to 4 notes in a music piece and they learn how to perform different pieces of music together as a team. They are also taught the necessary skills of note reading, playing with expression, and good technique. Teamwork, concentration, a keen sense of hearing, and showmanship are equally important for a piece of music to be played well.

  

AGPS Handbells Ensemble members are given opportunities to perform in various school-based events such as Unplugged Fridays and the Annual AGPS Prize Award Ceremony (PAC). Selected members also take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) biennially. During the weekly practice, friendship and strong camaraderie are also forged which is essential to enhance their performances.

  

All these aim to cultivate our members to become aspiring, confident, and joyful musicians. We strive to Nurture Talents, Develop Character, and Groom Pupils to be Leaders so that they can contribute to the community, in line with the school motto of Aspire, Grow and Serve through our CCA and beyond.
