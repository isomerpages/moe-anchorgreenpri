Our weekly training sessions at AGPS Drama Club offer a transformative learning experience for our students, empowering them to reach new heights in stage performances. Through expert guidance and exploration of diverse drama techniques, we nurture budding actors, equipping them with the skills to shine. <br><br>
By participating in various school events, our students gain hands-on experience in all aspects of theatre, from the spotlight to behind-the-scenes. Our ultimate goal is to ignite a lifelong passion for theatre and foster confidence in acting and English communication, helping our members grow into creative, expressive, and articulate individuals.
